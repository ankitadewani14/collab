In my MERN stack-based Online Food Delivery App, I integrated a secure payment system using Stripe, allowing users to make payments for their orders directly through the platform. The payment integration handles different payment methods, ensuring a seamless user experience during the checkout process. The system also includes features like order confirmation, payment history, and secure transaction processing. This project demonstrates my ability to work with third-party APIs and integrate payment systems while maintaining security and user privacy. The complete solution includes front-end React components for payment processing and back-end Node.js routes to handle the payment logic with Stripe.
